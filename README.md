Welcome to LMMS's LoMMuS repository. **LoMMuS** is our Discord bot formerly operated by [StakeoutPunch](https://github.com/StakeoutPunch), now it is maintained by the LMMS developers.

Currently, the repository isn't really fit for use, as the code here is written in a local-only context, which doesn't make deployment easier. Feel free to contribute and make PRs.

The old README is located in [README.old.md](README.old.md), which displays notes and commands available at the time.
